# Mobile Music Player (Side Project)

This folder contains the scaffold and plan for a cross-platform React Native music player app.

Purpose:
- Keep a side project to build a React Native music player that complements Meta-Googler
- Prototype mobile UX for identification, AI-powered metadata, and playback

What's in this folder:
- `PLAN.md` - Full phase-by-phase development plan (copied from your provided file)
- `src/` - Starter directories for components, screens, services, etc.
- `package.json` - Minimal dependency list to get started (Expo friendly)
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `.gitignore` - Node & Expo ignores

How to start (recommended):
1. Install Expo CLI (recommended for rapid prototyping)
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   cd mobile_app
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. Or initialize a new Expo app and move files in as needed.

Notes:
- This is a scaffold for development; most files are placeholders and need implementation
- Follow `PLAN.md` for weekly milestones

Happy building! 🚀
